Given three input values representing counts of nickels, dimes, and quarters, output the total amount as dollars and cents.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point using the following statement:
System.out.printf("Amount: $%.2f\n", dollars);

Ex: If the input is:

3 1 4
where 3 is the number of nickels (at $0.05 each), 1 is the number of dimes (at $0.10 each), and 4 is the number of quarters (at $0.25 each), the output is:

Amount: $1.25
For simplicity, assume input is non-negative.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class LabProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Get the number of nickels
        int nickels = scnr.nextInt();

        // Get the number of dimes
        int dimes = scnr.nextInt();

        // Get the number of quarters
        int quarters = scnr.nextInt();

        // Calculate the total amount in cents
        int totalCents = 5 * nickels + 10 * dimes + 25 * quarters;

        // Convert the total amount in cents to dollars
        double dollars = totalCents / 100.0;

        // Print the amount in dollars and cents with two decimal places
        System.out.printf("Amount: $%.2f\n", dollars);
    }
}
